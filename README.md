# RecipeTracker

App Name:
Grocery List

Description: 
List groceries needed to complete recipes. Add and manage recipes and ingredients. Create shopping lists for meals and/or recipes, or other lists of ingredients (DO NOT create a class called "List", this can get confusing)

## Goals

Understand user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks, points, and sprints.
Conceptually connect user stories to unit tests.
Be able to plan a sprint and split features/epics into manageable tickets.

## Requirements:

Create user stories (5-10)
Create tickets/tasks (at least 12)
Point the tickets using the Fibonacci rule or by T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL)
Plan a sprint
Divvy up tickets so everyone has roughly equal points
Plan some stretch goals - what are some extra things you would like to get done beyond your MVP, if you have time?
Begin work on the app

## Google Doc Link
In this Link we shared all our user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks, points, and sprints. We then communicated to divide tasks evenly for each person to work on using the Fibonacci rule as a point system.
